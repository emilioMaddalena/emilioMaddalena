## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:grin: I'm a Brazilian/Italian/Japanese guy who likes all things data science and AI.

:mortar_board: I've got a PhD in machine learning from EPFL (Lausanne), and my MSc and BSc were in electrical engineering and controls.

:computer: Finance, engineering and tech consulting are some of the fields I've already worked on.
